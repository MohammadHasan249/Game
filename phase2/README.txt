README file for Trifecta Game:

- General Application:
    No need to install any plugins or anything, just run the app and sign up/login.
    	-It should all work upon clone
    We accidently did all our work for phase 2 in the phase 1 folder. But we also managed to migrate the	 files to phase 2 folder so it should work in this folder too

- Button Click Game (Whack-A-Button):
    Once you choose your customizations, start this game and every second or so, you'll see a button
    appear onto the screen. Clicking that button gives +1 score and adds one to the total clicks,
    while clicking any other invisible button off-screen adds one to the total clicks only.

    BONUS (Hidden Action): Clicking on a visible button three times quickly multiplies your score
    by 2!

- Math Game:


- Flip Card Game:
	The FlipCardGame do not require any additional modules to run
	We implemented MVP design pattern! Please have a look
	INSTANT REPLAY: the flipcard game has a replay button when the game ends, it will display
		the replay of every exact action you took when playing
