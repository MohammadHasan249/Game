README file for Trifecta Game:

- General Application:
    No need to install any plugins or anything, just run the app and sign up/login.
    	- It should all work upon cloning.
    We accidentally did all our work for phase 2 in the phase 1 folder please mark everything in
    	the phase 1 folder
	- The UML are there too 

- Button Click Game (Whack-A-Button):
    Once you choose your customizations, start this game and every second or so, you'll see a button
    appear onto the screen. Clicking that button gives +1 score and adds one to the total clicks,
    while clicking any other invisible button off-screen adds one to the total clicks only.

    BONUS (Hidden Action): Clicking on a visible button three times quickly multiplies your score
    by 2!

- Math Game:
There will be one displayed number on the screen, and 4 buttons each displaying a negative value.
  The objective of the game is, to click the negative value buttons in any order and any amount of times
  to decrease the displayed value to 0 as many times as possible. New values are generated if the displayed value
  reaches zero or lower, points are only scored if user manages to decrease number to exactly zero.


- Flip Card Game:
	The FlipCardGame does not require any additional modules to run.
	We implemented MVP design pattern! Please have a look.
	INSTANT REPLAY: the FlipCard game has a replay button when the game ends, it will display
		the replay of every exact action you took while playing.
