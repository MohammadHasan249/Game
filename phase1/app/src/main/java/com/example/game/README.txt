README file for Trifecta:

- General Application:
    No need to install any plugins or anything, just run the app and sign up/login.

- Button Click Game (Whack-A-Button):
    Once you choose your customizations, start this game and every second or so, you'll see a button
    appear onto the screen. Clicking that button gives +1 score and adds one to the total clicks,
    while clicking any other invisible button off-screen adds one to the total clicks only.

    BONUS (Hidden Action): Clicking on a visible button three times quickly multiplies your score
    by 2!
