An Android Game with 3 Minigames!


Made this game with 3 other friends for a project in a 2nd year CS course at University of Toronto. Shoutout to them :)!

This was made purely in Android Studio, in Java.

The first minigame is a Math game, where the user has to bring down a random, given number to 0 using subtraction of one 
out of 4 possible numbers, within a time limit.

The second minigame is a ButtonClick game, where the user has to click on a button everytime it pops up, and there's a
specific time limit and speed for the disappearance and reappearance of buttons. It's similar to whack-a-mole. 
There is also a bonus, where if the user clicks on the same button 5 times in a row, it doubles their score.

The third minigame is a Flip the Card game, where the user has to pick a pair of cards and keep picking the right pairs until 
the deck is empty, in order to win the game. This minigame also has a replay function defined, where the user can replay every
move of theirs after the game ends!
